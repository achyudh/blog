title: "Propr - Assess pull request reviewability"

Do you merge pull requests day and night and wonder if you could convey the developers how you want their future pull requests to be? Are you a developer whose pull requests end up getting ignored despite being technically sound? Then, I built **Propr** just for you!.

A few months ago, along with a group of researchers from the Delft University of Technology, I set out to find out what contributes to the “reviewability” of pull requests submitted to open source projects. This led to the birth of Propr.

## How is this going to help you?
If you are an integrator who has longed for a way to anonymously provide feedback to the contributors, specifically on how they could make their pull requests easier to review, this is the right platform for you.

Rarely do you ever see anyone commenting on what they liked about a pull request or what made it easy to review. Further, comments on pull requests addressing how future patches could be made better detract from the technical heat of the argument at hand. These types of comments send positive or negative signals to the developers helping them shape future patches. GitHub may not be the right platform to deal with these aspects of pull requests that are in-fact necessary. With detailed feedback on their pull requests, contributors will no longer make pull requests with a goal of just getting it in. All of this results in less time spent reviewing code and well formed patches.

Presently, there is no way to collate feedback from integrators and project managers through GitHub over multiple pull requests and a range of projects. The reports dashboard to the rescue! Contributors to projects that use Propr can readily see how their pull requests are doing, and how they can improve them.

And that’s not just it! We are constantly adding more features into the reports interface, including a way to summarize comments automatically into various themes like code style, churn, change scope and the like. If a developer is consistently inconsistent in ensuring test coverage for his code, this report will ensure that he knows!

## As unintrusive as it gets
Propr does not affect your workflow. Not one bit. All we do is post a comment with a feedback link when pull requests are closed, and only when pull requests are closed. We don’t touch your code or steal private information.

## We value your privacy
We don’t store any personal information such as your email address or name and all feedback is collected anonymously. We ask for GitHub authentication as an identifier to account for duplicate feedback entries and to ease the process of filling the feedback form.

## Finally, it costs you nothing!
Where do I sign up you say? If you are project owner, all you have to do is click a button. Head on right over here: [http://propr.tudelft.nl/](http://propr.tudelft.nl/).

If you are contributing to a project that uses Propr and you want to see how you fare, all you have to do is to also click a button. Check out the reports dashboard here: [http://propr.tudelft.nl/report](http://propr.tudelft.nl/report)

_Happy forking!_
