<p>Hello there! I am Achyudh Ram, a research-oriented Computer Science student and a full stack developer from Chennai, India. As a fourth year undergraduate at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, I am currently pursuing two major degrees: <i>B.E. (Hons.) Computer Science</i> and <i>M.Sc. (Hons.) Economics</i>.</p>

<p>I am strongly inclined towards research and my interests revolve primarily around <i>social network analysis, information retrieval, neural networks, and machine learning</i>.  I have an enduring passion towards data science, software and web development. I also have worked on projects in simulation, statistics, econometrics and financial forecasting.</p>

<p>I had interned at the economic research and planning division of Indian Bank last year and had a brief stint at the student faculty council for Economic course review.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>At BITS Pilani, I have scored a <b>CGPA of 9.66/10.0 with 9.9/10.0 in Computer Science courses</b>. I have consistently received the institute scholarship for academic merit for being ranked among the <i>top 1% of the student body</i>. I have completed a wide range of courses ranging from Data Structures and Algorithms to Machine Learning and Neural Networks. </p>

<p>I was schooled under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) curriculum with a specialization in Computer Science. I scored a CGPA of 10.0/10.0 in the Secondary School Examination (Class 10) and 94.8% in the Senior School Certificate Examination (Class 12).</p>

<h2>Skill Set</h2>
<p>I am proficient in a range of languages including C/C++, Python, Java, R, and Verilog HDL. I also have working experience in MATLAB/Octave BASH, SQL, HTML, CSS and ARM, MIPS32 and x86 Assembly.</p>

<p>I am familiar with a broad range of toolkits and environment like MySQL, Visual Studio, Stata, LaTeX, ModelSim, Xilinx ISE and Git VCS. I have also worked with the following libraries: Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK.</p>
<p>In my professional career, I have gained insight into database design, object oriented design, web design and development.</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>
<p>I am currently working on an <i>analysis framework to decode online communities</i>. The primary focus of this project is on decoding the rich history and the complex community structure present in popular online communities, by choosing mailing lists and IRC channels as a case study. </p>

<p>I have also worked on developing <i>Monte-Carlo methods to assess the feasibility of biofuel production</i>. This involved the simulation of various aspects of a biorefinery and its environment to forecast its profitability. </p>

<p>My first exposure to <i>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)</i> was when I was analysing various forecasting models to determine the breakeven for a bank. This study compared the machine learning based forecasting  methods to the more traditional approach, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. </p>

<p>My resume contains a more comprehensive view of the projects I have worked on, if you've got the time for it. If you are after the more interesting aspects of my work, be it the intricacies of overcoming setbacks or an overview of my workflow, do check out my blog.</p>
